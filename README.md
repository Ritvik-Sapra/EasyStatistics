Statistics is already hard enough to understasnd, let alone code them.
This package is made with the sole purpose of making available statistical tools available in Python.
Currently, this package has two main classes namely: [Gaussian](Docs/Gaussian/gaussianDistribution.md)
 and [Binomial](Docs/Binomial/binomialDistribution.md). Check out their docs on how to use it.

## Key features

1. Easily create instances of gaussian distribution by passing the mean and standard deviationof data.
2. Easily create instances of binomial distribution by passing the probability and standard deviation.
3. Calculate mean and standard deviation of the data.
4. Read file using in-built functions.
5. Add Gaussian or Binomial instances simply using the + operator.
6. Easy format for viewing details of an instance.

## Installation

Type ```pip install EasyStatistics``` in your terminal. The package will be installed and you will be able to use it.

## Importing package

In your project, you can either import Gaussian or Binomial (for now).

For Gaussian, type: ```from EasyStatistics import Gaussian```

For Binomial, type: ```from EasyStatistics import Binomial```
