# Binomial distribution

![Binomial Distribution](../images/binomialDistribution.png)

Binomial distribution is an important type when we work with data in Statistics.

With this class, we can easily and quickly make objects of binomial distirubtion.

We can either enter the probability and the size of the data
directly to create a Binomial object, or we can read a data file.

The objects created, can be plotted on histogram using in-built functions.

## Highlight

Two Binomial objects can simply be added and combined together as simply as:

```B1 + B2```

Where B1 and B2 are the two Binomial objects.
