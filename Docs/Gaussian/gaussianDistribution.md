# Gaussian Distribution

Gaussian distribution (a.k.a normal distribution) is rather the most used
and important type of distribution used in statistics. Most of the data are
represented in this form and it follows certain important rules.

With this package, we can make instances of gaussian distributions very quickly
and effectively.

## Highlights

We can simply add and combine two normal distributions by simple adding them
with **+** operator.

We can also calculate mean, standard deviation and do many other things.
